# HotelSystem (Y02)

The objective of the project was to design a Hotel Management System based on the Royal Kandyan
Hotel requirements. Which we gathered by visiting the location, talking to the staff members and looking at their existing system.

Since I was in charge of the Receptionist's part, this repo contains only that section. This system is a standalone Java program with the support of a Database to store all the details.


Some of the developed features were:
  * Will allow the receptionist to enter the customer’s details at the front desk and assign a room. This will be a simple UI so that the receptionist can easily enter customer’s details without focusing solely on the screen. This will allow the receptionist to also interact with the customer while entering details.
  
  * Allow the receptionist to handle any booking of banquet halls and meeting rooms, the system will keep track of the halls that are booked and the dates on which they are booked making it easier for the receptionist to see the current state of bookings when a customer wishes to make a booking.
  
  * When a guest is checking out they must hand over their keycard to the receptionist and then the receptionist can mark the room for inspection on the system and then once inspected any extra fees may be also added to the final bill.
